in this resulting directory
are some cinquecento programs that
demonstrate simple debugging activities.

to use them, you also need prctl and dwarf2cqct.  these
are available from cqctworld.org.

build dwarf2cqct and prctl and install them somewhere
in your path.

then,

    % cd l1
    % make    # build the cqct interpreter
    % cd demo
    % make    # build the demos

    # run the single-threaded demo
    % ../l1 ./tracelist.cqct

    # run the multi-threaded demo
    % ../l1 ./tracespawn.cqct

note that optional arguments to these demos show
off other features, e.g., system call tracing:

    % ../l1 tracelist.cqct 3 100
