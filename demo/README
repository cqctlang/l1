in this directory are some cinquecento programs that
demonstrate simple debugging activities.

to use them, you also need prctl and dwarf2cqct.  these
are available from cqctworld.org.

build prctl and dwarf2cqct and install them somewhere
in your path.

then,

    % cd l1
    % make    # build the cqct interpreter
    % cd demo
    % make    # build the demos

    # run the single-threaded demo
    % ../l1 ./tracelist.cqct

    # run the multi-threaded demo
    % ../l1 ./tracespawn.cqct

optional arguments to these demos show other features,
e.g., system call tracing:

    % ../l1 tracelist.cqct 3 100
