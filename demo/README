in this resulting directory
are some cinquecento programs that
demonstrate simple debugging activities.

to use them, you also need prctl,
a linux process control service
available from cqctworld.org.

build prctl and install it somewhere
in your path.

then,

    % cd l1
    % make    # build the cqct interpreter
    % cd demo
    % make    # build the demos

    # run the single-threaded demo
    % ../l1 ./tracelist.cqct

    # run the multi-threaded demo
    % ../l1 ./tracespawn.cqct

note that optional arguments to these demos show
off other features, e.g., system call tracing:

    % ../l1 tracelist.cqct 3 100
