ctlmux is a Cinquecento library for controlling
processes and threads.

ctlmux defines two abstractions:

* A ctl represents a thread of execution.  There is one
  ctl for each thread or process under control.

  Events in the execution represented by a ctl ---
  death, signals, system calls, creation of a new
  thread or process, execution of a new program,
  arrival at a breakpoint --- are reflected as ctl
  events.

  Behind every ctl are a pair of Cinquecento address
  spaces reflecting the current contents of its memory
  and registers.

* A mux is a ctl multiplexor that matches ctl events
  over a set of concurrently executing ctls with calls
  to user-defined Cinquecento handlers.

Begin with a fresh mux:

	mux = ctlmux();

For now, this mux can only control threads and
processes on the local machine.
