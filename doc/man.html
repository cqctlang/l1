<h3>Types</h3>

<p>
Cinquecento carefully draws a distinction between the
name of a C type and its definition.  Type names are
syntactic constructions used in C declarations, such
as <tt>int*</tt>.  They determine the C operations,
such as pointer dereference, that may be applied to a
cvalue of the named type.  The precise byte-level
meaning of these operations, however, is determined by
type definitions in the name space of the cvalue's
domain.
</p>

<p>
For example, the type name <tt>int*</tt> identifies the
type pointer-to-<tt>int</tt>.  A value of this type may
be dereferenced, but evaluation of the dereference
operation depends on additional information: the size
of the pointer and the size and encoding
of <tt>int</tt>.  This information comes from the
definition of <tt>int*</tt> provided by a name space.
In one name space, <tt>int*</tt> may mean a 64-bit
address of a 64-bit integer encoded in big-endian
order, while in another name space it may mean a 32-bit
address of a 32-bit integer encoded in little-endian
order.
</p>

<p>
Type definitions are encapsulated in first-class
Cinquecento values called <em>ctypes</em>.  A ctype is
a complete description of the layout and encoding of a
value in memory.  


A ctype for a structure, for example,
includes specification of the
