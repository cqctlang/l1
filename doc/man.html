<h3>Types</h3>

<p>
Cinquecento distinguishes the name of a C type from its
definition.  Type names are syntactic constructions
that appear in C declarations, such as <tt>int*</tt>.
They determine the C operations, such as pointer
dereference, that may be applied to a value of the
named type.  Evaluation of these operations, however,
requires knowledge of the layout and encoding of the
value in memory.  Type definitions provide this
information.
</p>

<p>
For example, the type name <tt>int*</tt> identifies the
type pointer-to-<tt>int</tt>.  A value of this type may
be dereferenced to yield a value of type <tt>int</tt>,
but evaluation of the dereference operation depends on
knowing the size of the pointer and the size and
encoding of <tt>int</tt>.  This information comes from
the definition of <tt>int*</tt>.  There are many
possible definitions.  One definition for <tt>int*</tt>
may be a 64-bit address of a 64-bit integer encoded in
big-endian order, while another may be a 32-bit address
of a 32-bit integer encoded in little-endian order.
One component of a Cinquecento name space is a function
that maps type names to type definitions.
</p>

<p>
Type definitions are encapsulated in first-class
Cinquecento values called <em>ctypes</em>.  Ctypes for
for arithmetic types define the size (number of bytes)
and encoding (byte order) of the values represented by
the type.  Ctypes for aggregate types (structures and
unions) include the overall size of the aggregate and a
specification of each field that includes the name of
the field, its offset from the beginning of the
aggregate, and its type definition.
