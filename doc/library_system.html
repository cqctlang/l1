<h3>Cinquecento Libraries</h3>
</div>

<p>
Cinquecento provides a syntax-based mechanism for modularizing code.
The primary goals of this system are both to allow the creation of libraries
that do not assign global variables, and to allow easy
swapping of different implementations for the same set of symbols into a 
given piece of code. 
</p>

<p>
In its most basic instantiation, a library is a file containing
definitions for various functions and variables. There is currently
no mechanism for putting macros (i.e. <em>@defstx</em> definitions)
in a library -- any macros appearing in a library currently gets bound
at the top level. Future version of the library system will remedy the
macro limitations.
</p>

<p>
An example library file might look this file, named <b>lib1.cqct</b>:
<div class="code">
<pre>
@local helper_func2;
@export( func1, func2 );

@define func1() { ... }
@define helper_func2() { ... }
@define func2() { ... }

</pre>
</div>
That code defines and exports two symbols: func1 and func2. 
It also defines a local variable helper_func2 that is visible only
within the library. 
Assuming lib1.cqct is in the load path, Another bit of code can 
then run using those symbols as follows:
</p>
<div class="code">
<pre>
@with_imports( lib1 ) {
  ...
  func1();
  ...
  func2();
  ...
}
</pre>
</div>
The <em>@with_imports</em> macro loads the library lib1.cqct, and
binds all of that library's exported symbols in the following scope.
Since lib1.cqct exports both <em>func1</em> and <em>func2</em>
both symbols will be available. If one already has a binding for 
<em>lib1_func1</em> and wants to bind it to a different symbol, 
one can do the following:
<div class="code">
<pre>
@define func1() { ... }
@with_imports( (lib1_func1, lib1.func1) ) {
  ...
  func1(); //calls above function 
  ...
  lib1_func1(); //calls func1 from lib1.cqct
}
</pre>
</div>
In this case, the function <em>func1</em> from lib1 is bound to
the symbol <em>lib1_func1</em> while the original binding for <em>func1</em>
remains unchanged. This sort of rebinding allows
a programmer to avoid symbol colision for symbols defined by multiple
libraries. 
</p>

<p>
When writing a library one can use <em>@import</em> instead of 
<em>@with_imports</em>.
Consider for example <b>lib2.cqct</b>
<div class="code">
<pre>

@export( something, somethingelse );
@import( lib1 );

@define something() { 
  ... 
  func1();
  ...
}
@define somethingelse() { ... }
</pre>
</div>
The <em>@import</em> macro only works inside a library file -- at the top
level <em>@with_imports</em> must be used instead. 
</p>

<p>
<em>@import</em> and <em>@with_imports</em> are both variable argument 
macros for which all of the following are legal:
<div class="code">
<pre>

@import( lib1, lib2 );

@with_imports( (f1, lib1.func1), lib2 ) { ... }

@import( (func1, lib1.func1), (lib1_func2, lib1.func2), lib2 );
</pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>
If one wants to import a file that is in a directory <em>dir1</em> 
that is in the load path, one may use the following constructions:
<div class="code">
<pre>

@import( dir1/lib, (f1, dir1/lib.func1));

@with_imports( dir1/lib, (f1, dir1/lib.func1) ) { ... }
</pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>
Imported libraries must be present in the load path. That is, when importing
from <em>lib1</em>, there must be a lib1.cqct present in the load path at
compile time. Recursive or mutually recursive libraries are not allowed.
Any <em>@defstx</em> statements in any library are 
bound globally during compilation. 
</p>

<h3>Dynamically determined imports</h3>

<p>The above macros allow one to specify at compile time which library
to import and what function renaming to do. 
If one wants to decide on the library that will be imported at runtime,
one can use the <em>dynamic_imports</em> macro. This macro is just like
the <em>with_imports</em> macro, except that it evaluates its arguments at
runtime and imports libraries specified by the resulting strings. 
For instance:
<div class="code">
<pre>

lib = "dir1"; // dir1/somthing.cqct defines fn1
lib2 = "dir2"; // dir2/something.cqct also defines fn1
foreach(@lambda(dir) {
  @dynamic_imports( sprintfa("(f, %s/something.fn1)",dir) ) {
    f();
  }
}, [lib,lib2]);
</pre>
</div>
</p>

<div class="docitem" id="fn:@add_loadpath">

  <div class="desc">
    This function adds the given path to the load path at compile time.
    Note that if path is computed using an expression, the expression will
    be evaluated at compile time before any compiled code has been run.
    Because of this, one can only use simple, self-contained expressions
    to compute path. For instance:
    <div class="code">
      <pre>
@loadpath("/"); //legal
@loadpath(loadpath[0]+"../something"); //legal
path = compute_path(); //this statement does not execute until run time
@loadpath(path); //error: path is unbound until runtime
@loadpath(compute_path()); //error: compute_path is also unbound until runtime

  Can only be used inside a library file. 
  Imports the named libraries and symbols. 
  For each import_spec, one of the following happens: 
<ul>
<li> If the import_spec is (dir/)*libname, then the library libname is loaded
from the loadpath concatenated with the specified directory sequence. All
symbols exported from that library are bound to locals in the current library.
For example:
<div class="code">
<pre>
@import( dir1/lib1 );
</pre>
</div>
Will import all symbols exported by the library found in the first 
dir1/lib1.cqct in the load path (the load path is searched in order). 
</li>
<li>If the import_spec is <em>(sym, (dir/)*libname.esym)</em>, 
then the library libname is loaded and the symbol esym from that library
is bound to the symbol <em>sym</em> in the current library. For instance
<div class="code">
<pre>
@import( (myfn1, dir1/lib1.fn1) );
</pre>
</div>
Will load the first file dir1/lib1.cqct found in the load path as a library
and set the local variable myfn1 to the value of fn1 in that library.
