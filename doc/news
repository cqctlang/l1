	The new syntax form @lazyapply calls a function
	without evaluating its arguments.

	The expression:

		@lazyapply(<fn>, <arg>, ...)

	is equivalent to

		<fn>(lambda(){ <arg> }, ...);

	Where <fn> and <arg> are arbitrary expressions.

	The new assignment operators ()= and {}= are
	like +=, but for casting.
	
	()= casts by type name.  The statement

		x ()= unsigned int;

	is equivalent in effect and value to

		x = (unsigned int)x;

	Likewise,

		x ()= struct dom`X*;
		
	is equivalent to

		x = (struct dom`X*)x;

	()= has the same precedence and associativity
	as the other assignment operators.

	In a similar way, {}= applies the extended cast
	operator to its operands:

		x {}= dom;

	is equivalent to

		x = {dom}x;
