debugging tips
--------------

hard faults in the system are signalled by the function "fatal"
and reported as "internal error".  the system
calls abort() after printing the error.
run under debugger to see the stack where the fault occurred.

soft faults caused by cqct program errors signalled by the function "vmerr"
and reported as "error".

set a breakpoint on "vmerr" to see the system stack where it occurred.

grammar
-------

why we have a separate tn_type_specifier:
- to force domain-relative ` names when using a typedef name

@names evaluation
-----------------

why we generate code for @names:
- user should be able to programmatically make any @names.
  by generating code, we ensure completeness and correctness of that support;
- some @names expressions must be evaluated at run time, when @names is eval'd;
  generating code provides natural form to eval and combine those results
