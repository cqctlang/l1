cracktype

locals share storage in stack frame for containing lambda;
initial value is undefined.
model is that you bind them before referencing them.

expressions in a @names form are evaluated in unspecified order;
cannot depend on side effects occurring in some order.

this seems potentially useful, but is not possible:
	x = 0;
	@(x+=4) int x;
	@(x+=4) int y;
