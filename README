l1 is an implementation of the Cinquecento programming language.

It runs on 64-bit and 32-bit x86 versions of Linux, OS X,
FreeBSD, and Solaris.

doc/man.html is a manual for the language.
The directory lib is a loosely organized collection of library code.

To build:

	% make

To test (requires python):

	% cd test
	% ./test.py

To run:

	% ./l1

The executable l1 is an interactive cinquecento
evaluator.  When run out of the directory in which it
was built, it will find the library code in the lib
directory.

The object l1.o can be linked into other programs (see
cqct.h and the manual).

There is more information about Cinquecento at cqctworld.org.
