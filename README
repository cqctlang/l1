l1 is an implementation of the Cinquecento programming language.

It runs on 64-bit and 32-bit x86 versions of Linux or OS X.

doc/man.html is a manual for the language.
The directory lib is a loosely organized collection of library code.

To build:

	% make

To test (requires python):

	% cd test
	% ./test.py

To run:

	% ./l1

The executable l1 is an interactive cinquecento evaluator.
If run out of the directory in which it was built,
it will find the library.

The object l1.o can be linked into other programs (see
cqct.h and the manual).

There is more information about Cinquecento at cqctworld.org.
