l1 is an implementation of the Cinquecento programming language.

It runs on 64-bit and 32-bit x86 versions of Linux, OS X,
FreeBSD, and Solaris. l1 is generally portable to 32 and 64 bit
machines with a C compiler.

doc/man.html is a manual for the language.
The directory lib is a loosely organized collection of library code.
The directory demo contains demonstrations (see demo/README).

To build l1:

	% make

To test (requires python):

	% make test

To run:

	% ./l1
	; printf("hello, world\n");
	hello, world
	;

The executable l1 is an interactive Cinquecento
evaluator.  This executable expects to remain in the l1
directory in which it was built, so that it can find
the library code in the lib directory.  A symbolic link
to this executable can also be executed.

The object l1.o can be linked into other programs (see
cqct.h and the manual).

There is more information about Cinquecento at cqctworld.org.
