@define no longer implicitly binds into the top-level.
@const no longer exists
the functions defined by @record are bound to the innermost scope,
  unless there are already bindings
veclen no longer exists (use always-equivalent length)
variables declared with @global and @local are initialize bound to nil
  (previously they were bound to the undefined value)
the value nil is now false in conditional context (previously true)
