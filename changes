better continuations:

- faster capture.

- unlimited stack depth

- continuation inspector


interactive overhaul:

- repl now implemented in cinquecento.

- nested repls, like chez cafes

- reader has always been problematic.
  a scheme reader 

- trapping exceptions and warnings

disassembler:




new function: mkstrm

	mkstrm(p,len)

	Mkstrm returns a string backed by the len byte
	range of memory in the calling process starting
	at p.

the definition of not is expanded to all values:
  not(0)   -> 1
  not(nil) -> 1
  else     -> 0

symbols beginning with @ can be constructed like other symbols:

	; '@foo;
	@foo



compilation:

Makefile defines OS, canonicalized name of OS.

builds based on conf/mk.$(OS)

generally based on conf/mk.unix

it would be easy to extend for per-arch configurations,
but this hasn't been necessary.


records (implement this!)
- cids instead of strings
- no more toplevel weirdness
